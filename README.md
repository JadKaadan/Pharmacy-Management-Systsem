# Pharmacy-Management-Systsem
-This is a Java-based GUI pharmacy management app built as a collaborative project. It allows users to:

-Add drugs with name, description, price, and quantity

-Edit descriptions, update prices or quantities

-Sell items and track sold drugs

-Refer to a doctor: based on user symptoms (e.g. "sore throat"), the system suggests matching drugs

-View inventory and remove drugs

-Display sold items on exit

Note: This was built as a university project with teammates.
